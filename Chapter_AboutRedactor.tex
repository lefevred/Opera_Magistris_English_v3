	\textbf{Currently}
	
	Working for the company \href{http://www.scientific-evolution.com}{{\color{blue} Scientific Evolution Sàrl}} specialized in consulting and training for high-potentials especially for quantitative analysts in project management, quality, engineering, finance and decision making (my main activity is to popularize advanced mathematical models for consulting firms and industrial companies). Incidentally, happy trainer and R\&D manager that gathers since young information from articles everywhere and now addicted to everything related to Applied Mathematics in the management of organization (Businesses, States), TQM (Total Quality Management) with Post-Taylorism and related softwares.
	
	Consultant in Applied Mathematics tutoring quantitative analysts (graduate and posgraduate) and gifted young students in French, English and German and author of several French and English books in the following areas:
	\pagebreak
	\begin{itemize}	 
		\item[$\bullet$] statistical process control (parametric and non-parametric methods)
		\item[$\bullet$] predictive modeling / advanced decision (decision trees, Markov chains)
		\item[$\bullet$] operations Research (quasi-Newton, simplex, genetic algorithms, algorithm GRG)
		\item[$\bullet$] data mining (neural networks, PCA, CA, regressions, scoring, clustering, etc.)
		\item[$\bullet$] risk modeling in project management and corporate finance (monte carlo, bootstrapping)

	\end{itemize}
	At this date I did interventions in over 200 companies, including $\sim$10 of to the Fortune 500 according to the 2009 listing and three universities and engineering schools in Switzerland for databases and stochastic risk simulations trainings. Training of several multinational executives in one to one.

	Consulting suits me well because it offers so many opportunities to see how different companies do things, to learn at a fast pace, and to be involved with interesting \& challenging projects.

	See my interview for Video2Brain \href{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOYwENyVPJQ}{{\color{blue}here}} and long time video training on scientific softwares by \href{http://www.alphorm.com}{{\color{blue}alphorm.com}}.

\textbf{Particularities}	

	I'm a stickler about processes, international standards and quality compliance in the professional world. I make a point of honor to make sure the welfare and development of employees when they have a job that matches their skills. I do not hesitate to say honestly what's wrong with my customers in terms of organization.
	
	Otherwise, I am passionate about computer science, applied mathematics (at all conceivable field), hi-tech systems and knowledge transfer. I always have tons of ideas in computing science and also in Applied Mathematics (but not enough time to complete each one)! I hate deeply reinventing the wheel or asking my colleagues doing so!

\textbf{Studies}	

	I'm graduated HES-SO\footnote{University of Applied Sciences and Arts - Western Switzerland} in Applied Physics in the option Nuclear Engineering. I completed  my Diploma at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL-Switzerland), in the department of experimental physics in condensed matter on Magneto-potentials.
	
	 I did also a small project on Langmuir probes in the Engineering School of Geneva for weakly and strongly ionized plasmas.
	
	The general knowledge of an Applied Physics HES engineer allow me to collaborate with different professional backgrounds (physicists, chemists, doctors, electricians, mechanics, computer, financial, etc.) to provide theoretical and technical assistance necessary to accomplish experimental projects.

	The syllabus in applied physics consists of a scientific background in mathematics, general physics, physics and nuclear chemistry, radiation, acoustic, electrical, electronics, micro-technology, numerical analysis and computing and physics of materials

\textbf{+Plus...}

	After my graduation in 2001 I first thought to continue at the university in order to become a teacher and after reflection, give roughly the same course during 40 years did not inspire me too  much (I get tired very quickly ...). I had finally chosen to be trainer in corporations so I can work in various fields (administration, engineering, management, modeling, design, development, assembly, etc..). It suits me in that technology changes very quickly and the audience (employees and company executives speaking German, English or French) and sometimes the case studies are very complex and financially with a strategic importance (several million or billion dollars).

	Passionate about everything related to Applied Mathematics since the age of twelve, I wanted in connection with my professional work to continue in my passion. To make the pleasant also useful (the reverse is also true) and after noticing that lacked of free educational and quality resources on the Internet in French (in the early 2000s) about theoretical physics, I decided to translate what I learn every day on my way in this book. I wish I could go on as long as possible, I still have plenty to learn and so many others to communicate and science is so vast...

In addition to this book, I wrote many electronic courses on various products and methods that can be found on the Internet in various specialized sites (just by googling my name).
